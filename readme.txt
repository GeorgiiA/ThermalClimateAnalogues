The  ThermalClimateAnologues repository contains the shapes, rasters and legends for MapWindow projects that provide geovisualization of climate model outputs.

The file WorkingProject.mwprj is the MapWindow project that can be open by a click when you install MapWindow 4.8.8.

This is an initial stage of the project aimed to  provide geovisualization of climate model outputs in the form of thermal climate analogues for the present local climates. The references to the sources of information can be found in the paper available at <http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24784>.

Detailed description of the files contained in the repository is to be added.
